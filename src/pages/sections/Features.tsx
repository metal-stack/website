                      In combination with Kubernetes, the bare-metal approach
                      fully eliminates the need for a hypervisor. As servers can
                      be provisioned within minutes, hardware can be replaced
                      quickly while Kubernetes automatically cares for your
                      applications to run reliably all the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our bare-metal design offers physical tenant separation as
                      well as resistency against malicious attacks like Spectre
                      and Meltdown.

                      The rack cabling is part of our solution, too. It is
                      failure redundant and allows to easily scale up and extend
                      your infrastructure with more racks as you grow.

                    Together with our friends from the open-source project
                    Gardener, metal-stack can serve as a cloud provider for
                    delivering bare-metal Kubernetes clusters at scale. We
                    strive for being a serious, on-premise solution to
                    hyperscaler offerings.

                    metalstack.cloud is our hosted version of metal-stack. It is

                    The API of metal-stack provides hardware for users as
                    self-service. The underlying automation reaches down to the
                    network switch infrastructure and the server hardware. It is
                    self-inventorizing and prevents growing chaos over time. The
                    DevOps-driven data center enables even small platform teams
                    to operate huge infrastructural landscapes while keeping
                    operational costs low.

                    In addition to that, managing your own hardware at scale can
                    give you a striking cost-performance ratio as it enables you
                    to scale out rapidly.

                    On the switch hardware and the servers, metal-stack is

                    As a special decision in infrastructure architecture, we
                    enforce firewalling on dedicated physical machines before
                    users can reach out of their private tenant network. Say
                    goodbye to large firewalls with outgrowing sets of rules.
                    Instead, let the users manage them directly through
                    Kubernetes with dedicated custom resources.
