# gardener-extension-csi-driver-lvm

Provides a Gardener extension for managing [csi-driver-lvm](https://github.com/metal-stack/csi-driver-lvm) for a shoot cluster.

As a safety measurement, the extension checks for the old [csi-lvm](https://github.com/metal-stack/csi-lvm/tree/master) and stops reconciling if the old driver is still available.
If not the extension will reconcile the new `csi-driver-lvm`.

The following storage classes will be created by default:

- `csi-driver-lvm-linear` for linear volumes
- `csi-driver-lvm-mirror` for mirrored volumes for improved redundancy on multiple physical volumes
- `csi-driver-lvm-striped` for striped volumes for improved performance on multiple physical volumes
- `csi-lvm` for backwards compatibility with type linear.

When encryption is enabled (see below), three additional LUKS-encrypted storage classes are created:

- `csi-driver-lvm-linear-encrypted`
- `csi-driver-lvm-mirror-encrypted`
- `csi-driver-lvm-striped-encrypted`

See [docs/migration.md](./migration.md) for further information about migrating from `csi-lvm` to `csi-driver-lvm`.

## LUKS Encryption

LUKS block-device encryption can be enabled per shoot by adding an `encryption` field to the `providerConfig`. When set, the three encrypted storage classes above are created. Each class instructs the CSI node plugin to open the LUKS device using a key read from a Secret in the shoot cluster.

### Setup

1. Create the LUKS key Secret in the shoot cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n <namespace> create secret generic csi-lvm-encryption-secret \
     --from-literal=passphrase="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   ```

   > **Important:** This Secret is part of your cluster's recovery data. Back it up securely. Losing it makes encrypted volumes permanently inaccessible.

2. Reference the Secret in the shoot's `providerConfig`:

   ```yaml
   extensions:
   - type: csi-driver-lvm
     providerConfig:
       apiVersion: csi-driver-lvm.metal.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
       kind: CsiDriverLvmConfig
       devicePattern: /dev/nvme[0-9]n[0-9]
       hostWritePath: /etc/lvm
       encryption:
         secretRef:
           name: csi-lvm-encryption-secret
           namespace: <namespace>
   ```

3. Create a PVC using one of the encrypted storage classes:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: my-encrypted-pvc
   spec:
     accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]
     storageClassName: csi-driver-lvm-linear-encrypted
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 10Gi
   ```

### Notes

- Both `secretRef.name` and `secretRef.namespace` are required when `encryption` is set; the extension will refuse to reconcile with either field empty.
- The Secret is user-owned and is not managed by the extension. It will not be deleted or overwritten during reconciliation.
- `StorageClass.parameters` are immutable in Kubernetes. If you need to change the secret reference, delete the encrypted storage classes manually and allow the extension to recreate them.
- Removing `encryption` from `providerConfig` deletes the encrypted storage classes but does **not** affect existing PVCs or the underlying LUKS devices.

## Development

This extension can be developed in the gardener-local devel environment. Before make sure you have created loop-devices on your machine (identical to how you would develop the csi-driver-lvm locally, refer to the repository [docs](https://github.com/metal-stack/csi-driver-lvm?tab=readme-ov-file#development) for further information).

```sh
for i in 100 101; do fallocate -l 1G loop${i}.img ; sudo losetup /dev/loop${i} loop${i}.img; done
sudo losetup -a
# use this for recreation or cleanup
# for i in 100 101; do sudo losetup -d /dev/loop${i}; rm -f loop${i}.img; done
```

1. Start up the local devel environment
1. The extension's docker image can be pushed into Kind using `make push-to-gardener-local`
1. Install the extension `kubectl apply -k example/`
1. Parametrize the `example/shoot.yaml` and apply with `kubectl -f example/shoot.yaml`
