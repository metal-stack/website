# Roadmap

For metal-stack we share a [Github board](https://github.com/orgs/metal-stack/projects/34) that displays our roadmap. It gives a rough overview over our development focus.

If you have ideas to improve metal-stack, please suggest your thoughts on the [discussions page](https://github.com/metal-stack/releases/discussions) in the releases repository.

## Planning Meetings

Public planning meetings are held **biweekly** on **odd calendar weeks** from **14:00 to 14:30** (Berlin/Europe timezone) on Microsoft Teams. The purpose is to provide an overview of our current projects and priorities, as well as to discuss new topics and issues within the group.

export function PlanningMeetingDatesTable() {
  const today = new Date();
  const dayOfWeek = today.getDay();

  let daysUntilMonday = 0;
  switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case 0:
      daysUntilMonday = 1;
      break;
    case 1:
      daysUntilMonday = 0;
      break;
    default:
      daysUntilMonday = 8 - dayOfWeek;
  }

  const nextMonday = new Date();
  nextMonday.setDate(nextMonday.getDate() + daysUntilMonday)

  let onejan = new Date(today.getFullYear(), 0, 1);
  let week = Math.ceil((((nextMonday.getTime() - onejan.getTime()) / 86400000) + onejan.getDay() + 1) / 7);

  if (week % 2 === 0) {
    nextMonday.setDate(nextMonday.getDate() + 7)
  }

  const blacklist = [
    new Date('2025-12-29'),
  ]

  const amount = 8
  const dates = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < amount; i++) {
    const nextDate = new Date(nextMonday);
    nextDate.setDate(nextDate.getDate() + (i * 14))

    if (blacklist.find(item => {return item.toDateString() == nextDate.toDateString()}) !== undefined ) {
      continue
    }

    dates.push(nextDate.toDateString())
  }

  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>Date</th>

        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {dates.map((date, index) => (

### Meeting Agenda

Here is the agenda that we generally want to follow in a planning meeting:

- Possibility to bring up news that are interesting for every developer of the metal-stack org
- Check `Done` column and archive cards
  - Attendees have the chance to briefly present achievements if they want
- Check the `In Progress` column and discuss whether these tasks are still worked on, there were significant blockers or they can be lower-prioritized
- Check new issues labelled with `triage` and prioritize them
- Allow attendees to bring up issues and prioritize them
  - Attendees have the chance to briefly present these new issues
