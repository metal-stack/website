# Community

The Open Source culture lives from an active community! We are very happy about everyone who wants to actively participate in the metal-stack project. Feel free to reach out to us on our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/metal-stack/shared_invite/zt-3eqheaymr-obQueWBLOMkhbEWTZZyDRg)!

You can also meet us in person at conferences and community events, such as [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/), [Gardener Hackathons](https://gardener.cloud/community/hackathons/), and more. Many of these events are announced on our [blog](/blog/tags/conferences) as well.

We have a [public roadmap](./03-roadmap.mdx) and hold regular [planning meetings](./03-roadmap.mdx#planning-meetings).

If you want to contribute code, please also refer to our [contribution guidelines](./02-contribution-guideline.md).

When you read to this point: Welcome, and we look forward to seeing you soon! 😊
