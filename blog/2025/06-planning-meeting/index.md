Since the GitHub Projects V2 API has enough features for our project, we decided to set up public planning meetings for our development on the metal-stack project. The planning board can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/metal-stack/projects/34).

The meetings are held **biweekly on odd calendar weeks** from **14:00 to 14:30** on Microsoft Teams. The purpose is to provide an overview of our current projects and priorities, as well as to discuss new topics and issues within the group.

You can find the link to join in our documentation [here](https://docs.metal-stack.io/dev/developers/planning-meetings/). If you want to get an invitation to the event, please drop us a line on our [Slack channel](https://metal-stack.slack.com).

Planning meetings are currently not recorded. The meetings are held either in English or German depending on the attendees.

Hope to see you there!
