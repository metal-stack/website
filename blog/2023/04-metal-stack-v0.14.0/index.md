In metal-stack v0.14.0 we have added support for [SONiC](https://sonicfoundation.dev/), the operating system for the switches in a metal-stack managed data center.

## Introducing SONiC

Until today we have been driving the switch infrastructure of metal-stack with an operating system called [Cumulus Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_Networks#Cumulus_Linux). And we were very satisfied with it. However, as Cumulus Networks was acquired by Nvidia, Cumulus Linux [is being discontinued for Broadcom-based switches](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux-44/Whats-New/#unsupported-platforms). Hence, starting from Cumulus Linux 5, [only support for Spectrum-based switches will continue](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking-ethernet-software/cumulus-linux-50/Whats-New/#platforms), which unfortunately requires us to migrate away from the OS.

As open source is in the nature of metal-stack, the decision for the replacement fell on SONiC. SONiC was originally created by Microsoft, open sourced in 2016, and is today governed by the Linux Foundation. The OS is based on Debian and supports a wide array of devices and platforms, such that we can open up for a wider compatibility with metal-stack.

Similar to Cumulus Linux, SONiC also utilizes [FRR](https://frrouting.org/) as a routing daemon, such that it was possible to re-use our existing configurations (as applied by [metal-core](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-core), a small metal-stack component running on the leaf switches).

The entire task was described in enhancement proposal [MEP-10](https://github.com/metal-stack/docs/pull/106).

A big shoutout to everyone who contributed to this huge shift in technology! Key players were [@mwindower](https://github.com/mwindower), [@GrigoriyMikhalkin](https://github.com/GrigoriyMikhalkin), [@robertvolkmann](https://github.com/robertvolkmann),[@majst01](https://github.com/majst01), [@mwennrich](https://github.com/mwennrich) and [@mreiger](https://github.com/mreiger). You rock! üôÇ

### Operations

For deploying SONiC-based switches, the [metal-roles](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-roles) repository now contains a [sonic role](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-roles/tree/v0.8.15/partition/roles/sonic). As the role comes with a lot of configuration options, it is suitable for deploying leafs, spines and exit switches. Components like the `metal-core` will automatically be configured for SONiC when getting deployed as the Ansible playbooks will automatically detect the underlying switch OS.

After the deployment, in `metalctl` you will be able to see the switch OS now (with a üê¢ indicating Cumulus Linux and a ü¶î indicating SONiC):

## Summary of Further Additions

In this release we also announce:

- The support of Debian 12 as an OS image for Kubernetes worker nodes. Checkout [metal-images](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-images/releases) for further release information.
- A row of `metalctl` improvements were introduced:
  - Searching the audit traces with `audit ls`.
  - Creation, update and deletion through file with `-f`.
  - Choices between bulk print and individual print during bulk operations like `apply -f` including interactive security prompts.
- Support for Gardener v1.53, including SSH key rotation on workers and the firewall.
- Performance improvements for the [metal-ccm](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-ccm), drastically decreasing traffic on the metal-api
